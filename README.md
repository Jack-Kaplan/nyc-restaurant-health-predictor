# Project Planning Document

**Contributors:** Dominik, Jack, Muhammad, Mauricio  
**Project Name:** **Health Inspection Predictor**

---

## Project Scope
Develop a predictive model that forecasts **restaurant health inspection scores or grades** using factors such as **location, cuisine type, and past violations**.  
The project will also **visualize key patterns and trends** in health code violations.

---

## Key Features
- **Feature 1:** Predict health inspection scores.  
- **Feature 2:** Generate visualizations of inspection scores by **location, cuisine type, and other variables**.  
- **Feature 3 (Optional):** Integrate **Google Maps API** to map restaurant locations and display their inspection grades.

---

## Frameworks / Libraries

| Layer | Tools / Frameworks |
|-------|--------------------|
| **Frontend** | React, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js (or D3.js) |
| **Backend** | Flask or FastAPI (Python) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL or SQLite |
| **Other Tools** | Google Maps API, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook |

---

## Audience
This project is designed for:  
- **Everyday users** who want to be aware of restaurant health inspection results.  
- **Restaurant owners** who want to analyze whether **location or cuisine type** affects their health inspection grades.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Planning:** Define project scope, gather dataset, assign roles.  
2. **Development:** Build and train predictive model, create API endpoints, develop dashboard.  
3. **Testing:** Evaluate model accuracy, fix frontend/backend bugs, perform user testing.  
4. **Deployment:** Host on web server (e.g., Render, Vercel, or AWS) and publish GitHub repository.
